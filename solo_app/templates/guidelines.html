        <h3>Your pledge to the CommunEty</h3>
        <br>      
                 
        <h5>1. Be respectful to your neighbors</h5>
            <p>You are speaking to your real neighbors. Strong communities are built on strong relationships.</p>
        <h5>2. Do not discriminate</h5>
            <p>Help build a society that does not tolerate racism, hateful language, or discrimination of any kind.</p>
        <h5>3. Discuss important topics in a safe and respectful way</h5>
            <p>We have policies and dedicated spaces for important non-local topics, such as national politics.</p>
        <h5>4. Promote your local gift economy</h5>
            <p>We have created designated spaces for members and local businesses to share products and services. </p>
        <h5>5. Use your true identity</h5>
            <p>CommunEty is built on trust — we want everyone to know they’re communicating with their real neighbor, and therefore require you to use your true identity. </p>
        <h5>6. Do not engage in harmful activity</h5>
            <p>We prohibit any activity that could hurt someone, from physical harm to scams.</p>
        <br> 
        <p> You, our members who make up this CommunEty, play a key role in neighborhood moderation 
            by reporting content or members that violate these Guidelines. Please remember that 
            disagreeing with a post is not a reason to report it.<br>
            Our CommunEty pledge to you is to create an environment where Everyone feels welcome.
        </p>

        <h5>Let the CommunEty begin!</h5>
